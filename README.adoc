Pretty Good Query Producer (PGQP)
=================================

Overview
--------

PGQP is a lightweight Java library that generates database queries from POJO field values in a type-safe way using a database framework like JPA.

Using a query definition that specifies how POJO fields are to be converted into restriction clauses and how sort enums map to columns in tables, PGQP not only creates the necessary where and order by clauses, but it also generates any needed joins.

Motivation
----------

A common database-related task is to transform non-null values in a POJO into a database query (e.g., a bean that backs a search form).

This can be a tedious process for POJOs with many fields: 

* test if a field is set; 
* if it is, add a where-clause, adding joins as necessary; 
* repeat for each field in the POJO.


The first beneft offered by PGQP is that, using Java-8 method handles, it allows the mapping between field values and where-clauses to be specified independently of the application of the mappings.  That is, the library user specifies the mappings and the library takes care of generating the restrictions in the query.

A second tedious part of translating bean fields to where clauses occurs when multiple tables are involved.  In order to add restrictions related to a table not part of the root table (the from clause), it is necessary to create a join to the table the restriction column is in.  However, in most cases, tables should only be joined once, making it necessary to keep track of which tables have already been joined in the query.

The second benefit offered by PGQP is that it allows the restriction mapping to specify the table it is related to and how the table should be joined into the query.  That is, the library user specifies the table information for the restrictions and PGQP takes care of generating the needed joins.

Further complicating things, some restrictions, if naively mapped to regular joins, may produce duplicate rows in the result set because the criteria is one-to-many with the root table. One solution to this problem is to use a distinct clause in the projection.  An issue with this solution is that it often suffers from performance problems and may lead to issues with other parts of the query (e.g., BLOB columns) footnote:[https://blog.jooq.org/2016/03/09/sql-join-or-exists-chances-are-youre-doing-it-wrong/].

The third benefit offered by PGQP is that it detects one-to-many restrictions and translates these restrictions into a semi-join (in-clause + sub-query restriction).

Finally, in order to add order by clauses that potentially span multiple tables, it is necessary to insure that the tables containing the column to be sorted on is part of the query using the proper type of join.

The fourth benefit of PGQP is that it insures that tables needed for the order by clauses are properly joined into the query.

API
---

The `QueryHandler` interface defines the entry point for the library.  The interface has two methods: one that generates an "entity" (data) query (`toEntityQuery`) and one that generates a count query (`toCountQuery`).  Both methods take a `QueryDefinition` object as a parameter and return a query object in some implementation (e.g., a JPA `CriteriaQuery` object).

The `QueryDefinition` class has two fields: a criteria POJO and an (optional) list of `SortInfo` objects.

The `SortInfo` class has two fields: a sort enum and a sort direction (ascending or descending).

Finally, while PGQP works with regular types (e.g., strings, numbers, dates, etc.), it also provides a generic `CriteriaField` class that encapsulates a value and an operation, as defined in the `StandardOperation` enum.  This enum contains common operations such as equality and inequality, less than and greater than, and string functions such as starts with, contains, etc.  The `CriteriaField` class can be used to make the POJO mapping even more flexible.

Implementations
---------------

PGQP currently targets JPA and makes use of the static metamodel generator classes footnote:[https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.0/topical/html/metamodelgen/MetamodelGenerator.html[https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.0/topical/html/metamodelgen/MetamodelGenerator.html]].

The `JoinDefinition` class is used to specify how to navigate from one entity to another.  It maps a field on a parent table to a child table (e.g., `person.employer`).

THe `RestrictionMapping` classes is used to map a bean property to how the value should be used in restricting the query.

The `SortDefinition` class defines how an enum maps to an attribute in an entity class.

The fundamental  JPA-related class in the PGQP is `RestrictionDefinition`.  This class specifies how a restriction clause is to be applied to a query.  This is done using a `BiFunction` that takes a `QueryContext` object (`CriteriaBuilder`, `CriteriaQuery` and `Path`) plus the value of the attribute in the bean and returns a `javax.CONTAINS_FIELD_HANDLER..criteria.Predicate`.  The PGQP library takes care of properly adding the restriction to the `CriteriaQuery` (e.g., CONTAINS_FIELD_HANDLER).

While there is a lot of expressive power in specifying the restriction mapping in this way, the most common `BiFunction` implementations can be found in the `JpaCriteriaHandlers` class.

Examples
--------

In this example, there are two entity classes: Person and Business.  Project Lombok is used to generate getters and setters.

.Person.java
[source, java]
@Data
@Entity
public class Person {
	@Id
	private Integer id;
	private String firstName;
	private String lastName;
	private LocalDate birthdate;
	@ManyToOne
	private Person parent;
	@ManyToOne
	private Business employer;
	@OneToMany(mappedBy = "parent")
	private Collection<Person> children;
}

.Business.java
[source, java]
@Data
@Entity
public class Business {
	@Id
	private Integer id;
	private String name;
	private String address;
	@ManyToOne
	private Person owner;
	@OneToMany(mappedBy = "employer")
	private Set<Person> employees;
}

To work with Person-related queries, we first need to map the various joins that may be needed when creating a query.  Ordinarily, we'd encapsulate these definitions in a class so we can use them in other parts of the mapping.

A `JoinDefinition` instance is parameterized with the type of table it is joining from and the type of table that it is. We use the JPA Metamodel generated classes to define these definitions in a type-safe way.

The root table has no parent; it is always present in the query.

.Root Person mapping
[source, java]
private JoinDefinition<?, Person> PERSON_TABLE = new JoinDefinition<>("person", 
    Person.class);
	
To join to the business table, we start from the person table and navigate via the `employer` field.

.Business mapping
[source, java]
JoinDefinition<Person, Business> BUSINESS_TABLE = new JoinDefinition<>("business", 
    Business.class, PERSON_TABLE, new AttributeInfo<>(Person_.employer));

To join to owner information, we start from the business entity and navigate via the `owner` field.  Note that the type of the join, like the root table, is `Person`.

.Owner mapping
[source, java]			
JoinDefinition<Business, Person> BUSINESS_OWNER_TABLE = new JoinDefinition<>("owner", 
    Person.class, BUSINESS_TABLE, new AttributeInfo<>(Business_.owner));
			
Finally, to work with restrictions related to a Person's children, we define a join mapping from `Person` via the `children` field.  Note that this mapping is potentially one-to-many: a Person may have zero-or-more children.  Note that this join type is also `Person`.

.Children mapping
[source, java]			
JoinDefinition<Person, Person> CHILD_TABLE = new JoinDefinition<>("child", 
    Person.class, PERSON_TABLE, new AttributeInfo<>(Person_.children));

Having defined the various types of tables in the system, we can now define sorts and how they map to  entity fields.  

First we define the sort enum that defines the fields that can be sorted on.

.PersonSort.java Enum
[source, java]	
public enum PersonSort {
	FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, BUSINESS_NAME, OWNER_LAST_NAME
}

A `SortDefinition` maps an enum value to a table join and field:

.PersonSort mappings
[source, java]	
new SortDefinition<>(PersonSort.FIRST_NAME, PERSON_TABLE, Person_.firstName)
new SortDefinition<>(PersonSort.LAST_NAME, PERSON_TABLE, Person_.lastName)
new SortDefinition<>(PersonSort.BUSINESS_NAME, BUSINESS_TABLE, Person_.name)
new SortDefinition<>(PersonSort.OWNER_LAST_NAME, BUSINESS_OWNER_TABLE, Person_.lastName)

The search criteria is driven by a bean. PGQP works with regular types -- `String` and `Boolean` below; it can also work with special types that specify both a value and an operation -- `CriteriaField<String> lastName` is an example of this.

.PersonCriteria.java
[source, java]
@Data
@Accessors(chain = true)
public class PersonCriteria {
	private String firstName;
	private CriteriaField<String> lastName;
	private String companyName;
	private String ownerName;
	private String childName;
	private Boolean underageChildren;
	private Boolean employed;
	private Boolean hasChildren;
}

To map a criteria to a restriction, we use the `RestrictionMapping` class.  The standard constructor takes a getter and a `RestrictionDefinition` object.

The `RestrictionDefinition` constructor takes a table join, a table field and a `BiFunction` that produces a JPA `Predicate` object.  The `BiFunction` construct gives complete control over the `Predicate` construction. However, in many cases we simply want to use a well-defined mapping like equality, contains, is null, etc.  Here are a few examples.

.Person first name mapping to a contains restriction
[source, java]
new RestrictionMapping<>(PersonCriteria::getFirstName, 
    new RestrictionDefinition<>(PERSON_TABLE, Person_.firstName, CONTAINS_FIELD_HANDLER))

.Business name mapping to a like restriction
[source, java]
new RestrictionMapping<>(PersonCriteria::getCompanyName, 
    new RestrictionDefinition<>(BUSINESS_TABLE, Business_.name, LIKE_FIELD_HANDLER))

.Person employed mapping to a not null restriction
[source, java]
new RestrictionMapping<>(PersonCriteria::getEmployed, 
    new RestrictionDefinition<>(PERSON_TABLE, Person_.employer,
    notNullFieldHandler(Business.class)))

Here is a more complicated example:

.Person mapping for whether they have underaged children
[source, java]
new RestrictionMapping<>(PersonCriteria::getUnderageChildren,
    new RestrictionDefinition<>(CHILD_TABLE, Person_.birthdate, 
    (context, value) -> value ?
        context.getCriteriaBuilder()
            .greaterThan(context.getPath(), LocalDate.now().minusYears(18))
		: context.getCriteriaBuilder().
		    lessThan(context.getPath(), LocalDate.now().minusYears(18)))
			
Finally, here's an example of creating a sub-query for whether a Person has children:

.Person mapping for whether they have children
[source, java]
new RestrictionMapping<>(PersonCriteria::getHasChildren, 
    new RestrictionDefinition<>(PERSON_TABLE, Person_.id, (context, value) -> {
	    Subquery<Integer> sq = context.getQuery().subquery(Integer.class);
	    Root<Person> root = sq.from(Person.class);
		sq.select(root.get(Person_.parent).get(Person_.id))
		    .where(root.get(Person_.parent).isNotNull());
		In<Integer> in = context.getCriteriaBuilder().in(context.getPath()).value(sq);
		return value ? in : in.not();
    }
))

To create a query handler, we create a list of the restriction handlers and the sort mappings.  In addition, for the purpose of creating sub-queries, we need to specify the type of the primary key field (`Integer.class`) and how to access the primary key from the root table (`r -> r.get(Person_.id)`).

With these pieces, we can create our query handler.

.JpaQueryHandler creation
[source, java]
QueryHandler<CriteriaQuery<Person>, CriteriaQuery<Long>, Person, PersonCriteria, PersonSort> queryHandler = new JpaQueryHandler<>(entityManager, Person.class, Integer.class, r -> r.get(Person_.id), getRestrictions(), getSorts());

Using the query handler, we can execute queries against the database via the JPA EntityManager.

Here are some examples.  

.Query to find people with the first name of Sally, ordered by last name 
[source, java]
QueryDefinition<PersonCriteria, PersonSort> qd = new QueryDefinition<>(
    new PersonCriteria().setFirstName("Sally"), Stream.of(PersonSort.LAST_NAME));
CriteriaQuery<Person> cq = queryHandler.toEntityQuery(qd);
TypeQuery<Person> tq = entityManager.createQuery(cq);
List<Person> people = tq.getResultList();

Note that the `toEntityQuery` returns a `CriteriaQuery` object which can be further manipulated, if needed (e.g., to set a limit and/or offset for the query).  Note also that, using the exact same `QueryDefinition` object, we could instead do a count query by change the `queryHandler.toEntityQuery` to `queryHandler.toCountQuery`.

.Query to find people with the last name of Smith, ordered by first name descending
[source, java]
entityManager.createQuery(
	queryHandler.toEntityQuery(new QueryDefinition<>(
		new PersonCriteria().setLastName(new CriteriaField<String>(StandardOperation.EQ, "Smith")),
		Arrays.asList(new SortInfo<>(PersonSort.FIRST_NAME, Direction.DESC)))))
	.getResultList();

.Query to find the number of unemployed people with no children
[source, java]	
entityManager.createQuery(
	queryHandler.toCountQuery(new QueryDefinition<>(
		new PersonCriteria()
			.setHasChildren(false)
			.setEmployed(false))))
	.getSingleResult()	
		
As you can see, the high level use of the `QueryHandler` is very straightforward: simply specifiy the applicable fields on the criteria bean and (optionally) specify sorts.  The details involved in constructing the query are contained in the mappings that were used to create the `QueryHandler`.
